# JST-Loop-For

The JavaScript Template for For Loops.  The repo is located at: <https://github.com/joseph-kaainoa/jst-loops-for>.

## Introduction

This is simple node console app to see how to use the JavaScript for... loop syntax.

The samples are in different files, the most basic is configured for the built-in "start" event <https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts>, with the more complex samples are in their own file.

### List of Samples

The following samples are included in this repo:

* Simple Loop - The basic syntax of a for loop
* Basic Loop (script: "basic01") - A for loop with branching logic
* Reverse Loop (script: "basic02") - A simple loop starting at the end of the data and looping forward

## To Run

In order to run the simple loop code, use "npm start" in the terminal.

For the other samples, look in the package.json file and use "npm run `<scriptName>`".

For example, to run the first basic loop, use "npm run basic01"

## Requirements

Other than having npm installed, there are no libraries this depends on.
